# Pre-rendering

Each time a documentation page is accessed, docs.page will attempt to serve a static version of the page to improve
performance. If the page has never been accessed before (or a new docs.page deployment has invalidated the cache),
users will be shown an initial loading page whilst the content is fetched. Subsequent visits to the page will
show the cached content.

If the content is older than 30 seconds old, the page will be regenerated in the background and future requests will use
the newly generated page.

> Read more about this on the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#static-generation-recommended).

Since docs.page supports _any_ GitHub repository it is not possible to pre-render every documentation page at build time. Instead
we ask that if you wish to enable pre-rendering for your repository you explicitly define the repository to enable pre-rendering.

## Enabling pre-rendering

Create a pull request to add your repository to the [`repositories.json`](https://github.com/invertase/docs.page/edit/master/repositories.json) file on the docs.page
repository.

Once merged, all `.mdx` files within the repositories `docs/` directory will be scanned and the page will be pre-rendered.
