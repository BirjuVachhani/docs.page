# Custom Domains

Custom 3rd party domains can be used on `docs.page`, allowing you to remove the `https://docs.page/:org/:repo/:path*` URL
from your documentation, and use a custom domain instead.

You can see custom domains in action by viewing the [Melos repository documentation](https://melos.invertase.dev).

When enabling a custom domain, requests to existing `docs.page` domain (e.g.`https://docs.page/:org/:repo/:path*`) will
be redirected to your custom domain.

## Setup

A couple of manual steps are required before you can serve docs via your custom domain.

## 1. Domain DNS

The first step is to point your domain at our domains service. Using your domain provider, create a
DNS record:

| invertase.dev | record type |       value       |
| :-----------: | :---------: | :---------------: |
|       @       |    CNAME    | domains.docs.page |

Subdomains are also supported:

| invertase.dev | record type |       value       |
| :-----------: | :---------: | :---------------: |
|     melos     |    CNAME    | domains.docs.page |

If you are using a proxy service (e.g., Cloudflare), ensure you disable the proxy to allow the `docs.page`
proxy service to provide SSL for you.

## 2. Add domain

Create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/invertase/docs.page/edit/master/domains.txt) to modify the [`domains.txt`](https://github.com/invertase/docs.page/blob/master/domains.txt)
file at the root of the docs.page repository.

Create a new line, adding your domain followed by the GitHub organization and repository, for example:

```txt
melos.invertase.dev invertase/melos
```

Once your Pull Request is approved and DNS has been propagated, you are ready to start using your custom domain.

## Local development

If you are [contributing](/contributing) to the `docs.page` project whilst running a page with a custom domain, you'll
need to modify your local hosts to locally map the domain:

```
127.0.0.1       melos.invertase.dev
```

docs.page will automatically handle ports during local development.
