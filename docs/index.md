## Why?

At [Invertase](https://invertase.io) we're always building new Open Source products for the community.
One of the most important yet undervalued aspects of a successful Open Source product is documentation.
Using GitHub README files or Wiki's is a great place to start, however common issues quickly start to arise:

- Markdown only supports basic HTML.
- Documentation isn't searchable.
- Adding navigation is tricky, slow and repetitive.

Existing solutions such as GitHub pages, or building a custom documentation website help solve these problems, 
however also come with additional overhead:

- The websites need to be hosted somewhere.
